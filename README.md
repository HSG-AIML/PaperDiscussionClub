# AI:ML Paper Discussion Club
This repository contains a list of papers that we will discuss in the paper discussion meetings every week. <br>

## Question list
In every meeting participants can provide a list of questions that he/she finds interesting. We also have a fixed list of question that we aim to answer in every meeting:<br>

- What is the main idea?
- What is the main contribution of the paper?
- What is the level of novelty of the paper?
- What are the key components/steps of the introduced method?
- How do these key components/steps relate to the state of the art? (entirely new idea, taken from a different domain, sligth extension...)
- What are advantages and disadvantages to the introduced method?
- What assumptions does the paper make for it's method? (i.e., distributions, training behavior, features..)
- Does the paper show experiments to critically test it's assumptions, results and conclusions, or are they cherry-picked?

<br>To be completed ...
